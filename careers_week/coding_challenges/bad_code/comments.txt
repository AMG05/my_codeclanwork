Some comments we came up with as a class:

- poor use of ternary operators
- questionable of way of considering error message
- unclear as to what the function actually does
- very poor naming
- first param to focused and map aren't map
- mistake in param name (consistency)
- variable 'e' is shadowed in the map function
- use of var
- trying to reassign a value to a const variable
- use of single/double quotes instead of template literal
- no comments/documentation as to what the code does
- could store Object.keys(error) in a variable so we don't have to call it up to 12 times
